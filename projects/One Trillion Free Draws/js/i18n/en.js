     * A list of verbs for the player to choose from. Each verb contains a list of forms
     * that are used to be inserted into strings. For example: In English, `"free {draws}"` can be replaced 
     * into "free draws", "free pulls", or "free summons" based on the verb the player selected in Settings.
     * 
     * Because a language might have different verbs to refer to the act of drawing, this is not a hard list.
     * Feel free to add or remove verbs as fit for your language.
     * 
     * Each verb can contain different forms of the same verb needed for the language, i.e. in English a verb
     * can have a past tense (drew), a present participle (drawing), and a past participle (drawn).
     * Keys of forms are used to be referenced in the string so it's recommended to be translated. You can 
     * declare as much verb forms as your language needs.
     * 
     * `_anim` is used to determine per-verb special card opening animation. For example: `_anim: "spin"`
     * makes the card pack spin while it is opened and should be used on verbs that are near in meaning
     * to the word "spin".
     * 
     * `_equiv` declares a verb's equivalent verb in English and is used to determine which verb to change to
     * when the player changes the game's language.
     *
