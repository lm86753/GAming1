"Glass City" is a visually stunning and strategically deep city-building simulation game set in a futuristic world where all structures are crafted from advanced, transparent materials. Players are tasked with designing, constructing, and managing a sprawling metropolis made entirely of glass, focusing on aesthetics, efficiency, and sustainability. The objective extends beyond mere population growth; it involves creating a harmonious urban ecosystem where citizens thrive amidst a delicate balance of resource production, energy management, and environmental impact. The unique "glass" aesthetic isn't just cosmetic; it influences gameplay through challenges like light reflection, structural integrity, and the need for innovative architectural solutions to maintain privacy and comfort within transparent buildings. Players must meticulously plan their city's layout, infrastructure, and services to create a utopian society.
