"Interactive Buddy" is a classic sandbox physics simulation game where players can unleash a variety of tools, weapons, and natural phenomena upon a hapless ragdoll figure, the "Buddy." The objective isn't traditional victory, but rather experimentation, creative destruction, and often, generating as much chaos and points as possible. Players are given an array of items, from simple weights and ropes to explosives, firearms, and even elemental forces like fire and water. The game's charm comes from its realistic (for its time) physics engine, allowing for satisfying chain reactions and endless scenarios of cause and effect. It's a stress-reliever, a creative outlet, and a humorous playground for those who enjoy manipulating a digital puppet in increasingly elaborate ways. Points are typically awarded for damage inflicted and various interactions, encouraging players to discover new, more destructive combinations.
