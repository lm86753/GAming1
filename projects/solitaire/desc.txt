"Solitaire," most commonly referring to Klondike Solitaire, is a classic single-player card game played with a standard 52-card deck. The objective is to move all cards to four foundation piles, one for each suit, in ascending order from Ace to King. Players start with a tableau of seven columns of cards, with the top card of each column face-up. The remaining cards form the stock and waste piles. Gameplay involves strategically moving cards between tableau columns (building down in alternating colors), from the stock/waste to the tableau, and eventually to the foundations. Success requires careful planning, foresight, and a bit of luck, as not all games are winnable. It's a timeless game praised for its ability to provide a relaxing yet mentally stimulating experience, perfect for passing time and exercising logical thinking.
