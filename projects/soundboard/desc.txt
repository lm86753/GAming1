A "Soundboard" is not a game in the traditional sense, but rather an interactive utility or application designed for instant playback of a collection of audio clips, sound effects, or short musical pieces. The objective is to provide users with a customizable and easily accessible interface to trigger specific sounds on demand. It can be used for various purposes: entertainment (prank sounds, funny quotes), content creation (adding sound effects to streams/videos), educational tools (language learning, musical notes), or even accessibility. Users typically interact with a grid of buttons, each corresponding to a unique sound. Many soundboards allow for customization, enabling users to upload their own sounds, organize them into categories, and assign them to specific buttons or hotkeys. Its appeal lies in the immediate gratification of sound playback and the creative potential it offers for personal expression and interaction.
