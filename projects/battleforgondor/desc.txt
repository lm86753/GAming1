"Battle for Gondor" is an engaging and strategic Flash tower defense game set in the iconic universe of The Lord of the Rings. As the commander of Gondor's defenses, your primary objective is to protect the great city from relentless waves of Orcs, Trolls, and other monstrous creatures pouring forth from Mordor. You must strategically place and upgrade a variety of defensive units and towers along the enemy's path to prevent them from reaching and breaching the city gates.
