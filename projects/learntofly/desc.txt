"Learn To Fly" is a charming and addictive physics-based launch distance game with incremental upgrade mechanics. Players take on the role of a determined penguin whose goal is to learn how to fly by launching itself off a ramp and gliding as far as possible. The core objective is to improve the penguin's flight capabilities through a series of upgrades, including gliders, rockets, boosters, and payloads, to achieve ever-greater distances and altitudes. Each launch provides currency based on performance, which is then used to purchase new equipment or enhance existing ones. The game features a humorous narrative, often involving a skeptical audience or rivals, and a satisfying loop of launching, analyzing performance, upgrading, and launching again. The ultimate goal is to break flight records and defy gravity, proving that even a penguin can soar.

Controls:
- Arrow Keys (Left/Right): Adjust launch angle (before launch) or control flight pitch/roll (mid-flight, if equipped with gliders/wings).
- Spacebar: Activate boosters or deploy special items (mid-flight).
- Up Arrow Key: Launch (at start).
- Mouse (Left Click): Navigate menus and purchase upgrades.

Special Features:
- Physics-Based Launch: Realistic (and often comically exaggerated) physics govern the penguin's flight.
- Extensive Upgrade System: A wide array of gliders, boosters, rockets, and payloads to unlock and improve.
- Incremental Progression: Continuous improvement of flight capabilities through earned currency and upgrades.
- Humorous Narrative: Engaging story about a penguin's quest for flight with a lighthearted tone.
- Replayability: Endless attempts to optimize launches and break personal distance records.
- Achievements & Challenges: Specific goals and challenges to complete for bonus rewards.
- Stat Tracking: Detailed statistics on flight performance to aid in strategic upgrading.
- Variety of Stages/Environments: Progress through different launching areas or atmospheric conditions.
