"You Are Bezos!" is an satirical idle/incremental game that puts players in the shoes of a billionaire tech mogul, specifically mimicking the journey and controversies surrounding Jeff Bezos. The objective is to accumulate unimaginable wealth, expand a global empire (often at the expense of workers or the environment), and engage in various philanthropic or eccentric billionaire activities. Gameplay typically starts with simple clicks to generate initial income, which is then invested into automating processes, acquiring new businesses, launching rockets into space, or funding personal vanity projects. The game often features a humorous take on real-world economic and social issues associated with extreme wealth, presenting players with moral dilemmas and comical challenges. It's a game about exponential growth, strategic investment, and exploring the (often absurd) power that comes with being one of the richest people on Earth, all within a lighthearted, satirical framework.
