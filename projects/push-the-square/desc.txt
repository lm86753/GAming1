"Push The Square" is a deceptively simple yet intellectually challenging puzzle game where players manipulate a square block within a grid-based environment. The primary objective is to push the square (or a set of squares) to a designated target area, often a highlighted goal tile. The challenge arises from environmental obstacles, limited moves, and the fact that the square can typically only be pushed, not pulled or freely moved, and will continue to slide until it hits another object or wall. Levels are intricately designed to require clever planning, spatial reasoning, and foresight to navigate the square around various traps, gaps, and other movable blocks. The game often features a clean, minimalist aesthetic that focuses purely on the puzzle elements, providing a satisfying blend of casual accessibility and brain-teasing complexity. It rewards methodical thinking and an understanding of block-pushing mechanics.

Controls:
- Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) / WASD Keys: Move the player character (if applicable) or push the square in the corresponding direction.
