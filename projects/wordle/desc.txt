"Wordle" is a highly popular and addictive daily word puzzle game that challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six attempts or fewer. The objective is to deduce the secret word of the day using strategic guesses and feedback from each attempt. After every guess, players receive color-coded clues: green indicates a letter is correct and in the right position; yellow means a letter is correct but in the wrong position; and grey signifies the letter is not in the word at all. This feedback guides subsequent guesses, narrowing down the possibilities. The game's charm lies in its simplicity, accessibility, and the shared global experience of a single daily puzzle. It encourages logical deduction, vocabulary skills, and a bit of luck, providing a satisfying mental exercise that is often shared and discussed among friends and on social media.
