"Defend the Tank" is an engaging web-based strategy game that combines elements of tower defense and direct combat. Your primary mission is to protect a powerful tank, positioned as your central stronghold, from relentless waves of enemy forces. These enemies, ranging from ground troops to air units, will attempt to destroy your tank, and it's up to your tactical prowess and quick reflexes to ensure its survival.
