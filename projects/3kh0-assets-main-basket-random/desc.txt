Game Title: Basket Random

Description:
Basket Random is a quirky and unpredictable physics-based basketball game. Players control two ragdoll-like characters on a minimalist court, attempting to score baskets against an opponent. The objective is simple: be the first to reach a set number of points to win the match. The game emphasizes chaotic and often hilarious gameplay due to its unique physics engine, where characters flop and flail in unexpected ways, making every shot and movement a challenge. It's a lighthearted sports game perfect for quick, entertaining matches.

Controls:
The controls are typically very simple, designed for quick pick-up-and-play action.
- Player 1: Often uses the 'W' key or 'Up Arrow' to jump/interact.
- Player 2: Often uses the 'Up Arrow' key or 'W' to jump/interact.
(Specific controls can vary; usually, a single action button per player controls both movement and shooting in a physics-driven manner.)
