"Pandemic 2" is a strategic simulation game where players design and evolve a deadly pathogen (virus, bacteria, or parasite) with the ultimate objective of eradicating humanity. Starting with a single infected patient in a chosen country, players must strategically upgrade their disease's transmission vectors (e.g., air, water, livestock), symptoms (e.g., cough, fever, nausea), and resistances (e.g., drug resistance, cold resistance). The challenge lies in balancing the pathogen's lethality with its infectivity, as a disease that kills too quickly might be contained before it spreads globally, while a too-mild disease might not cause enough concern. Governments worldwide will react by closing borders, developing cures, and implementing quarantines, requiring players to adapt their disease's evolution to overcome these defenses. It's a dark, thought-provoking game that tests strategic thinking, resource management, and understanding of epidemiological principles.
