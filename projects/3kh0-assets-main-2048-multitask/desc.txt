"2048 Multitasking" is an expanded and more challenging version of the classic 2048 puzzle game, designed to test your strategic thinking on a larger scale. Unlike the standard 4x4 grid, this variant features a 7x7 grid, offering a much larger play area and dual objectives: create both a 2048 tile and a 3072 tile. This requires managing different sections of the grid simultaneously to build up high-value tiles, truly demanding a "multitasking" approach.

The core gameplay mechanics mirror the original 2048: use arrow keys to move all tiles in one of four directions. Identical tiles merge into a single tile with their combined value, and a new '2' or '4' tile appears after each move. The larger grid provides more maneuvering space but also intensifies the challenge of setting up crucial merges. Success depends on planning several moves ahead to prevent the board from filling up.

Controls:
- Arrow Keys: Move tiles (Up, Down, Left, Right)

- Expanded 7x7 grid: For a more complex and strategic experience.
- Dual objectives: Aim for both 2048 and 3072 tiles.
