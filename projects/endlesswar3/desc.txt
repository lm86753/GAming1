"Endless War 3" is a tactical real-time strategy (RTS) Flash game that immerses players in intense, large-scale military conflicts. As the third installment in the series, it expands upon its predecessors with improved graphics, more diverse units, and intricate mission objectives. The objective is to command your forces, deploy units strategically, and achieve victory against a relentless enemy across various battlefields. It combines elements of resource management, tactical combat, and base building (in some modes) to offer a comprehensive wartime experience.

The gameplay places you in control of a military commander on the battlefield. You typically start with a base or a small contingent of units, and your goal is to manage resources to produce more soldiers, tanks, aircraft, and other military assets. Missions often involve objectives such as capturing strategic points, destroying enemy bases, defending your own positions, or escorting VIPs. The real-time nature of the game demands quick decision-making and efficient unit deployment to counter enemy advances and exploit weaknesses. "Endless War 3" provides a challenging and engaging RTS experience for fans of military simulation and tactical warfare.
