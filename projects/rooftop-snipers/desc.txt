"Rooftop Snipers" is a chaotic and humorous 2-player physics-based fighting game where players battle it out on rooftops with an array of ridiculous weapons. The objective is to knock your opponent off the roof before they knock you off. The game features exaggerated ragdoll physics, making every movement and shot hilariously unpredictable. Players control their character's jump, aim, and shoot with a minimalist control scheme that adds to the challenge and comedic effect. Each round introduces different weapons, from pistols and shotguns to baseball bats and even flying saucers, leading to unique and often absurd combat scenarios. Its simple premise and focus on local multiplayer make it an ideal party game, generating endless laughter and intense, unpredictable showdowns as players struggle to maintain balance and land a decisive blow.
