"This Is The Only Level" is a deceptively simple yet highly ingenious puzzle-platformer that plays on player expectations. The core premise is that there is indeed "only one level" – a single screen with a simple platforming layout. However, the objective isn't to complete the level in a straightforward manner, but rather to find various, increasingly unconventional ways to interact with the environment and the game's mechanics to progress. Each "stage" of the game presents a new rule or twist that alters how the player character (often a small elephant) or the environment behaves, forcing players to rethink their approach to the same physical space. The game's charm comes from its clever subversion of traditional platformer tropes, its witty design, and the constant "aha!" moments as players discover how each new rule changes the game. It's a game that rewards creative problem-solving and an open mind, proving that simplicity can hide profound depth and endless fun.
