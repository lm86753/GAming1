"Idle Breakout" is an addictive incremental idle game that merges the classic arcade game Breakout with idle clicker mechanics. Players start with a simple paddle and a ball, breaking bricks to earn money. The core objective is to passively generate income and invest it into various upgrades, automation, and additional balls/paddles to accelerate brick-breaking and money accumulation. Initially, manual clicking is required, but quickly players can purchase auto-launchers, upgrade ball speed and damage, acquire special balls with unique properties, and even unlock prestige mechanics to further boost progression. The game features an endless loop of breaking, earning, upgrading, and repeating, providing a satisfying sense of continuous growth and optimization. It's designed for casual play, allowing progress even when the player is away, making it a perfect game for those who enjoy seeing numbers go up.
