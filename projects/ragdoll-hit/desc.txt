Ragdoll Hit is a physics-based action fighting game where players control a floppy ragdoll character and try to defeat opponents using momentum, timing, and environmental awareness. The main objective is to knock out or eliminate enemies by landing effective hits while staying balanced and avoiding being thrown off the arena. Combat is chaotic and often humorous due to the unpredictable ragdoll physics.

Gameplay focuses on movement and striking rather than precise combos. Characters react realistically to impacts, meaning every punch, kick, or collision can drastically change the fight. Players must use gravity, positioning, and timing to their advantage, often relying on knockback to send enemies into hazards or off platforms. Matches are quick and intense, encouraging experimentation and creative approaches rather than perfect execution.

The visual style is simple and minimalistic, keeping attention on character movement and physics interactions. The exaggerated ragdoll animations create funny and unexpected moments, making both victories and losses entertaining. Ragdoll Hit is easy to learn but difficult to master, as controlling momentum and balance becomes increasingly important against tougher opponents.
