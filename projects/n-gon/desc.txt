"N-Gon" is a minimalist and challenging arcade puzzle game that centers around the manipulation of a multi-sided polygon (the "N-Gon") within a confined space. The objective is to navigate the N-Gon through a series of increasingly complex mazes and obstacles without colliding with the walls or hazards. The game often features a unique mechanic where the N-Gon can change its number of sides (e.g., from a triangle to a square, then a pentagon, etc.), altering its collision shape and how it fits through narrow passages. This requires players to strategically adapt their N-Gon's form to solve spatial puzzles and overcome environmental challenges. Its clean, geometric aesthetic and precise physics create an intensely focused experience that demands spatial reasoning, quick reflexes, and forward planning. Success comes from mastering the N-Gon's transformations and timing movements perfectly.

Controls:
- Arrow Keys / WASD: Move the N-Gon (e.g., up, down, left, right).
- Spacebar / X Key: Change the number of sides/form of the N-Gon.
- R Key: Restart level.
- Escape Key: Pause game / Access menu.
