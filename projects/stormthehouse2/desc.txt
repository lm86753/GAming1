"Storm The House 2" is an intense, action-packed tower defense/shooter game where players must defend their house from endless waves of stick-figure invaders. The objective is to survive for as many days as possible, strategically building defenses, upgrading weapons, and managing resources to repel increasingly formidable enemy attacks. Players control a character inside the house, firing various weapons (pistols, shotguns, machine guns, grenades, etc.) at incoming stick figures. Between waves, resources earned from defeating enemies can be used to repair the house, purchase new weapons, upgrade existing ones, or build defensive structures like barricades and turrets. The game features a simple, yet effective stick-figure aesthetic, focusing on the frantic action and strategic decision-making. It's a challenging and highly addictive experience that rewards quick reflexes, careful resource management, and effective defensive planning.
