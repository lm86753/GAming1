"Swerve" is a fast-paced, high-reflex arcade game that challenges players to navigate a constantly moving object (often a line or a snake-like entity) through an increasingly dense and intricate maze of obstacles. The objective is to survive for as long as possible without colliding with any of the environmental hazards or one's own trail (if applicable). Players typically control the object's direction with simple left/right inputs, constantly needing to "swerve" to avoid immediate dangers. The game features a minimalist aesthetic, often with vibrant colors and geometric shapes, that emphasizes clarity and speed. As the game progresses, the speed increases, the obstacles become more complex, and the reaction windows shrink, creating an intense and highly addictive experience. "Swerve" is an endless runner that provides a pure test of agility, foresight, and the ability to react under extreme pressure.
