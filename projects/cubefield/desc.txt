"Cubefield" is an iconic, minimalist 3D avoidance game that tests your reflexes and focus in a high-speed, ever-changing environment. The premise is stark: you control a small, triangular ship (or cursor) hurtling forward through an endless, flat plane populated by an oncoming field of cubes. The objective is to navigate through gaps in the cube formations, avoiding collisions for as long as possible, as the game's speed and density of obstacles continuously increase.

The gameplay is incredibly simple yet intensely addictive. Your ship automatically moves forward at an accelerating pace. Your only control is to steer left and right, guiding your vessel through the narrow passages that appear in the cube field. The visual style is intentionally abstract, using solid colors and basic geometric shapes to create a sense of overwhelming speed and imminent danger. The minimalist design ensures there are no distractions from the core challenge of avoiding impact, making "Cubefield" a pure test of reaction time and spatial awareness.
