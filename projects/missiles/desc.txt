"Missiles" is a minimalist arcade-style defense game where players are tasked with protecting a set of vulnerable targets (often cities or bases) from an endless onslaught of incoming missiles. The objective is to intercept and destroy all enemy projectiles before they reach their targets. Players typically control a stationary or limited-movement defense system, launching their own interceptor missiles to create explosions that clear sections of the sky. The challenge escalates rapidly as the number and speed of incoming missiles increase, requiring quick thinking, precise aiming, and efficient resource management (as interceptor missiles might be limited). The game usually features simple graphics that prioritize clarity of the action, focusing on the intense, strategic gameplay loop of identifying threats and coordinating defenses. It's a test of reflexes, pattern recognition, and tactical decision-making under pressure.
