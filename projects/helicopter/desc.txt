"Helicopter" is a classic, side-scrolling avoidance game renowned for its deceptively simple premise and brutally challenging gameplay. Players control a small helicopter that continuously flies forward through a narrow, horizontally scrolling cave or tunnel. The objective is to navigate the helicopter through the confined space without colliding with the cave walls (top or bottom) or any obstacles that may appear. The game employs a simple one-button control scheme, where pressing and holding the button makes the helicopter ascend, and releasing it causes it to descend due to gravity. Success hinges on precise timing and quick reflexes to maintain a delicate balance and avoid imminent crashes. The game offers endless replayability as players strive to beat their high scores, making each attempt a test of endurance and skill in a minimalist, yet highly addictive environment.
