"Stick War" is a popular real-time strategy (RTS) game where players command an army of stick figures to defeat enemy stick figure nations. The objective is to destroy the enemy's statue while defending your own. Gameplay involves a unique blend of mining gold to produce units, training various types of stick figure soldiers (archers, swordsmen, spearmen, giants), and strategically deploying them in battle. Players directly control their army's formation and actions (attack, defend, retreat) with a minimalist interface that belies the strategic depth. Each unit type has strengths and weaknesses, requiring players to build balanced armies and adapt to enemy tactics. The game features a simple, yet iconic stick figure art style, making it accessible and engaging. It offers a satisfying progression of unlocking new units, upgrades, and facing increasingly challenging AI opponents.
