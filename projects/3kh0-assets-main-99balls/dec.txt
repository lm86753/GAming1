99 Balls is a fast-paced arcade skill game focused on precision, timing, and strategic aiming. The player controls a launcher at the bottom of the screen and fires balls upward to break numbered blocks. Each block displays a number that represents how many times it must be hit before it disappears. The main objective is to clear as many blocks as possible and achieve a high score before the blocks reach the bottom of the screen, which ends the game.

Gameplay is simple to learn but difficult to master. Players start with a limited number of balls, and every successful hit reduces a block’s number by one. Collecting extra balls increases the total number fired in future turns, allowing for massive chain reactions when shots are angled correctly. The game emphasizes smart positioning, bank shots off walls, and long-term planning rather than speed. As the game progresses, blocks appear with higher numbers, increasing difficulty and requiring more precise shots.

The visual style is clean and minimalistic, making it easy to focus on gameplay. Animations are smooth, and the gradual difficulty curve keeps players engaged. 99 Balls is highly replayable, as each round plays out differently depending on player aim and strategy.
