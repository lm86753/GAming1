We Become What We Behold is a short, thought-provoking game about media influence, perception, and how small moments can shape society. Players take on the role of a photographer observing a simple world made up of circular characters and square characters living together peacefully. The main objective is not to win or lose, but to document moments by taking photos, which are then broadcast to the public and influence how the characters behave.

Gameplay is entirely driven by observation and choice. As the photographer, you move around the scene and choose what to photograph. Neutral interactions are often ignored by the audience, while conflict, fear, or dramatic moments gain attention and spread quickly. As these images circulate, the world begins to change—characters grow more paranoid, hostile, and divided. The game gradually escalates, showing how selective media coverage can amplify negativity and create societal breakdown.

The visual style is minimalistic and symbolic, using simple shapes and animations to communicate complex ideas clearly. The game is short but impactful, designed to be completed in one sitting. Its strength lies in its message rather than challenge, encouraging players to reflect on the consequences of attention, bias, and sensationalism.
