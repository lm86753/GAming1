"Webretro Local" is a web-based emulator frontend designed to play classic retro video games directly within a browser environment, likely configured for local access or personal ROM libraries. It is not a game itself, but a platform that allows users to revisit nostalgic titles from various console generations (e.g., NES, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy). The objective for the user is to load their favorite retro game ROMs and experience them with modern conveniences, often including save states, fast-forward options, and customizable controls. It aims to provide a seamless and accessible retro gaming experience without the need for dedicated software installations, focusing on ease of use and preserving the classic gameplay of beloved titles. This "local" version implies it is set up to run on a user's machine, perhaps serving as a personal arcade or game hub.
