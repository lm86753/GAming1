"Sort The Court!" is a charming and often humorous kingdom management simulation game where players assume the role of a newly crowned monarch. Each day, various subjects, petitioners, and bizarre characters approach the throne with requests, problems, or propositions. The objective is to make decisions (usually a simple "Yes" or "No" by swiping left or right) that balance the kingdom's resources (gold, population, happiness) and maintain stability. Each decision has consequences, sometimes immediate, sometimes long-term, affecting the kingdom's wealth, the loyalty of its people, and the overall happiness of the realm. The game's charm comes from its witty writing, quirky characters, and the moral dilemmas presented. It's a game about consequence and resource management under the guise of an amusing daily monarchy simulator, offering high replayability as different choices lead to varied outcomes and new challenges.
