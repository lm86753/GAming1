"Super Mario 64" is a revolutionary 3D platformer that redefined the genre and set a new standard for video games upon its release. Players control Mario in a vast, open 3D castle and its surrounding grounds, which serve as a hub world to access various painting-portals leading to diverse levels. The primary objective is to collect Power Stars by completing challenges within these levels, ultimately using these stars to unlock new areas and rescue Princess Peach from Bowser. Gameplay involves acrobatic platforming, exploration, puzzle-solving, and boss battles, all rendered in groundbreaking 3D graphics for its time. Mario's expansive move set, including triple jumps, wall jumps, and ground pounds, provided unprecedented freedom of movement in a 3D environment. Its innovative camera system, fluid controls, and imaginative level design made it an enduring masterpiece that heavily influenced subsequent 3D games.
